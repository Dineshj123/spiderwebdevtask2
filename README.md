##Hello!<br>
#####I'm Dinesh.My ROLL NO:110114024.<br>
######Here I have done Google maps api.To be Honest I don't know what is api initially.And after that<br> I surfed the net and understand what it is.Then I was confused to choose which api<br> as each one looked mighty.Then I chose this as it looked simple and achievable<br> to me since I was not worked with api's before.<br>This has been a quite good and memorable experience to me.<br>
<p id="id">
I have used the <strong><b>PHP+Apache</b></strong> server for this task.Together I have used the <strong><b>MYSQL</b></strong>database.<br>
The Database contains the following fields:
<ul>
<li style="font-size:100px;color:red"><b>id</b></li>
<li><b>Latitude</b></li>
<li><b>longitude</b></li>
<li><b>description</b></li>
<li><b>time</b></li>
</ul>
</p>
